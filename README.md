This application returns the value of s where s = n^2 * (n-1)
## More details 
In this example, we've set the value of n to 10 for simplicity, but in practice it could be any positive integer. The program initializes x and s to 0, then executes the nested loops to compute the sum of x and accumulate it in s. Finally, the program prints the value of s to the console.
